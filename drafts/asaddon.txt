To work with oohg as a addon:

1) Be sure your Harbour/xHarbour is working fine

   Remember that Harbour 3.2 and previous versions need HB_INSTALL_PREFIX
   set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:\harbour

   Create a test.prg:

   PROCEDURE Main

      ? "Hello world"

      RETURN

   On Harbour:  hbmk2 test.prg -n
   On XHarbour: hbmk2 test.prg -n -xhb

   If all ok, goto (6)

2) Be sure Harbour and C compiler are on path
   Check folders name where you install them

   example:

   set PATH=%PATH%

3) if you are using MSVC or BCC or POCC may be you need setup include and lib folders
   Check folders name where you install them.
   May be C compiler have a BAT to setp this, like on MSVC

   example:

   set INCLUDE=c:\harbour\comp\msvc2010\include
   set LIB=c:\harbour\comp\msvc2010\lib

4) If you are using XHarbour, then you need download hbmk2.exe from Harbour
   download to harbour\bin folder

5) Make test (1) to confirm if all ok

6) If you want OOHG on any folder, then create/update HBMK.HBC on harbour\bin folder
   Check where you install oohg, and set root path to this folder

   libpaths=c:\oohg\drafts

7) Create oohg library, on oohg\drafts folder
   hbmk2 oohgall.hbp

8) To test, go to oohg\samples\oohg and type

   Harbour:  hbmk2 maindemooop oohg.hbc
   XHarbour: hbmk2 maindemooop oohg.hbc -xhb

   note: -xhb is needed to use external Harbour.exe

9) If you do not want hidden .hbmk folders, you can use your workdir,
   but be sure to delete content when change project
   If you do not delete workdir content, may be one project mix files of another

   Example:

   del c:\temp
   hbmk2 maindemooop oohg.hbc -workdir=c:\temp
