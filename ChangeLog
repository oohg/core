2013-06-29 16:19 UTC-0300 Fernando Yurisich <fyurisich@oohg.org>
   * source/h_browse.prg
     + Added parameter lFixedBlocks to method Define.

   * include/i_xbrowse.prg
   * include/i_altsyntax.prg
   * include/i_hmg_compat.prg
     + Added support for FIXEDBLOCKS clause.
   NOTE: this clause changes the default behaviour of the control,
   causing the evaluation of the codeblocks used to set the values
   of each item's columns only at control's define time (or when
   adding a new column), instead of evaluating them each time an
   item is showed or refreshed. This clause may reduce the time
   needed to refresh a control with many columns.
   NOTE: at run time use ::FixBlock( .F. ) to return to default
   behaviour or use ::FixBlock( .T. ) to enable new behaviour (the
   codeblocks are evaluated using ::ColumnBlock() and stored in
   ::aColumnBlocks).
   NOTE: to change or refresh the codeblocks of a FIXEDBLOCKS control
   you can use the following code:
   ::FixBlock( .F. )
   ::aField := { new fields }
   ::FixBlock( .T. )
   Beware that changing ::lFixedBlocks or ::aColumnBlocks directly
   may cause RTE or impredictable behaviour.

   * source/h_grid.prg
     ! When doubleclicking on an empty row of a grid with
       horizontal scrollbar, the grid is scrolled to the left.
       This occurs because _GetGridCellData() does not check
       for a hit on an empty row.
       Fixed to not scroll anymore and to return all zeroes,
       so if on dblclick event is fired, the following conditions
       are true:
         _OOHG_ThisItemRowIndex == 0
         _OOHG_ThisItemColIndex == 0
         _OOHG_ThisItemCellRow == 0
         _OOHG_ThisItemCellCol == 0
         _OOHG_ThisItemCellWidth == 0
         _OOHG_ThisItemCellHeight == 0
         _OOHG_ThisItemCellValue == nil
     * Method ItemHeight now returns 0 if the grid has no rows,
       instead of returning a nonsense number.

       not processed.
   * source/h_controlmisc.prg

       a number to load one of the predefined cursors (see i_controlmisc)
       or pass a string to load one from resource file or disk.
       If the function fails trying to load IDC_HAND, it tries to load
       MINIGUI_FINGER cursor from OOHG's resource file.
     * Minor formatting.
   * source/h_hyperlink.prg
     * Changed: now uses ::Cursor(IDC_HAND) instead of direct assigning

       FORCEREFRESH issues a ::Refresh after an edition ends, so all
       items are shown in their proper places if the browse's dbf is
       indexed and the key fields were changed.
       NOREFRESH inhibits the relocation of such items.
       Default behaviour is EditItem method refreshes such item and
       EditAllCells method doesn´t.
     * Modified EditAllCells method to support FORCEREFRESH clause.
     ! Fixed: edition is finished after editing the last item of
       the browse without entering append mode when using FULLMOVE.

   * source/h_xbrowse.prg

       access them is VALUE.
     * All navigation is done using VALUE.
     * VALUE returns {0,0} is no valid cell is selected.
     * Navigation when no cell is selected behaves like grid by row:
       Home, Right and Down keys select cell {1,1}, Left and Up are
       ignored, PgUp selects first cell in the first row, PgDn
       selects leftmost cell of the last row of the first page and
       End selects rightmost cell of the the last row.

       if OnMouseDrop block returns a non nil value. Receives

     + Not nil ID parameter is now mandatory in AddItem(),

       item added or moved, or nil if there was no change in target.
     * TreeView_SetItem() and TreeView_GetItem() functions were
       renamed as TreeView_SetItemText() and TreeView_GetItemText().
     * CopyItem method changed: when the fourth parameter (aId) is
       not specified for a target which uses ITEMIDs, the missing
       IDs default to "C_" + <origin tree name> + "_" + <number>.
       Number will be automatically increased to avoid duplicates.
     + Added TreeView_SetSelectionID() function to change the ID
       of the tree's selected item.
     ! Fixed cancelation in Events method when processing WM_MOUSEMOVE
       message if hovered control in target list is not a Tree.

       value 0 -> Default behaviour: each time the control gots focus,
                  it's set to overwrite for TTextPicture and to insert
                  for the other classes.
       value 1 -> Same as default for the first time the control gots
                  focus, the following times the control remembers the
                  previous state.
       value 2 -> The control uses the state of the INSERT key.
     + Added METHOD InsertStatus: sets/gets the insertion status
